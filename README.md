# Pupil_Control

This project was created for the contest, and the results received a silver prize.<br>
This is a project to control screen scrolling through eye movement.<br>
This was developed based on the fact that most people use smartphones while using public transportation in a busy modern society, but it is difficult to control smartphones during rush hour, and by creating a program that can control the movement of electronic devices (e.g., scrolling down).<br>

After recognizing the face with the camera, I recognized the eyes and eyes. (Each face is marked with a blue square, eyes with a light green square, and iris with a blue square.)


If only the eyes are recognized and executed without facial recognition, the accuracy of the user's gaze will be reduced, but if the eye recognition rate is further improved in the future, it can only be recognized and used in small electronic devices such as smartphones.
In addition, our algorithm can be applied to various functions such as screen scrolling and screen flipping to increase practicality.
